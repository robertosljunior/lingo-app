# SLICE 7.2 — Real USE Provisioning, Semantic Calibration & Tutor UX — Checklist

Branch: `claude/local-semantic-tutor-rcd80y` (base `main`; PR #19 open, `mergeable_state: clean`, carries Slice 7.1 closure). Slice 7.2 is stacked on top on the same branch — the branch is the unit of work; commits land together when PR #19 merges.

Rule (self-imposed by spec): do not reduce scope; a blocked item is marked blocked in isolation and does not stop the rest; the final classification is chosen only after the whole checklist is walked.

## Asset-strategy decision (T03, recorded up front)
The Universal Sentence Encoder (`@tensorflow-models/universal-sentence-encoder` over `@tensorflow/tfjs`) is **not** part of the base bundle or the initial app load. The app runs fully on Harper + wink + rules + packs + the hashing fallback. The semantic model is an **opt-in, assisted download** (~28 MB) that is checksum-verified and stored offline. Model source: Google's canonical, immutable `storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-models/savedmodel/universal_sentence_encoder/*` (model.json + vocab.json + 7 weight shards), added to a dedicated **model allowlist** with our own pinned SHA-256 for every file. No mutable branch, no arbitrary pack-supplied URL, no remote code. In-browser backend: WebGL when available, CPU fallback (headless E2E uses CPU — WASM backend lacks the `SparseToDense` kernel USE needs).

## Spike evidence (pre-implementation, de-risks T04/T08)
Real USE loaded from local assets in headless Chromium (CPU backend): `dim=512`, `load_ms≈259` (warm), `embed_ms≈480/sentence`. Cosine sits in a narrow high band — dessert↔"something sweet" 0.889, dessert↔"sweet treat" 0.924, dessert↔"server offline" 0.876. Ranking correct; **absolute cosine is not usable as a global threshold** → confirms T11 (per-frame thresholds + margins) and T12 (USE is evidence, not sole authority).

## T01 — Preflight & baseline
- Status: completed
- git: branch `claude/local-semantic-tutor-rcd80y`, HEAD `f8016d8`, base `origin/main` `40005ee` (PR #18 merged). PR #19 open & clean, not yet merged → Slice 7.2 stacks on the same branch.
- Baseline commands: run below (see T24 for the final full re-run). Existing suites known-green from Slice 7.1A closure.

## T02 — Audit of existing USE path
- Status: completed
- `UseSemanticEncoderAdapter` / `createProductionUseLoader` / `ResilientSemanticEncoder` / `HashingSemanticEncoder` live in `semantic-encoder-adapter.js`.
- Current flow: `requested_engine: use` → `createProductionUseLoader({modelUrl,vocabUrl})` → if URLs absent throws `no_model_loader` → `ResilientSemanticEncoder` catches → `effective_engine: hashing`, `fallback_reason: MODEL_NOT_INSTALLED`. **No code treats hashing as real USE** — `report()` always tells the truth. The gap: nothing ever *provisions* `modelUrl`/`vocabUrl`, so `use` was never reachable. Slice 7.2 fills exactly that gap.
- tfjs/USE were not installed; now added (`@tensorflow/tfjs@3.21.0`, `@tensorflow-models/universal-sentence-encoder@1.3.3`, `@tensorflow/tfjs-backend-wasm@3.21.0`) as optional, dynamically-imported deps kept out of the base bundle.

## T03 — Asset strategy
- Status: completed (decision recorded above).

## T04 — Real production loader — completed
- `createProductionUseLoader` rewritten: reads checksum-verified bytes from the store, assembles `{modelTopology, weightSpecs, weightData}`, hands the model to USE via `tf.io.fromMemory` and the vocab via a `blob:` URL → fully offline, no service worker. Picks WebGL→CPU (WASM intentionally unused: it lacks the `SparseToDense` kernel USE needs). Structured error codes (MODEL_NOT_INSTALLED / MODEL_CORRUPTED / MODEL_INCOMPATIBLE / TFJS_BACKEND_UNAVAILABLE / MODEL_LOAD_FAILED); nothing reaches React as an exception. Telemetry (`__lingo`: model_version, backend, load_ms) on the returned model.
- tfjs/USE dynamically imported → Vite code-splits into a single `semantic-runtime-*.js` chunk, EXCLUDED from the workbox precache (globIgnores) and runtime-cached on first use. Base precache unchanged (~10.5 MB); no per-user cost until opt-in.

## T06 — Model download + validation — completed
- `semantic-model-catalog.js`: dedicated MODEL_ALLOWLIST (only Google's immutable tfjs-models origin, HTTPS), per-file SHA-256 pinned (9 files, ~27 MB), size + timeout + cancel guards, closed file list. `semantic-model-store.installModel`: per-file guarded fetch → size check → SHA-256 verify → staged in memory → single IndexedDB transaction commits all file rows + metadata together (active only on commit). Cancellable via AbortSignal; partial/tampered download installs nothing.
- Unit: checksum-mismatch installs nothing; cancel installs nothing; progress phases downloading/verifying/installing emitted.

## T07 — Persistence & embedding cache — completed
- Bytes + metadata persisted in the knowledge DB (v2, additive upgrade). `invalidateEmbeddingsExcept(model_version)` drops embeddings from any other model version on install/update/removal; packs/history/evaluations untouched. Unit-covered.

## T08 — Real USE in browser — completed (PROVEN)
- Proof through the app's OWN modules in headless Chromium (preview build, `context.route` serving the real pinned bytes locally since the sandbox browser has no proxy to the external origin):
  - INSTALL `{ok:true, model_version:"use-use-en-v1-v1"}`
  - STATUS `{requested_engine:"use", effective_engine:"use", fallback_used:false}`
  - ANALYSIS engines `{semantic_requested:"use", semantic_effective:"use", grammar_effective:"harper"}`
  - OFFLINE (network dropped + reload) STATUS still `effective_engine:"use"` — loads from IndexedDB, zero network.
- No mock, no hashing, no fake loader. Real 512-dim embeddings (see spike: paraphrase 0.924 > related 0.889 > unrelated 0.876).

## T09 — Hashing fallback — in_progress
- Loader already reports honestly (`ResilientSemanticEncoder.report()`; no code claims hashing is USE). Remaining: UI copy ("Modo básico ativo" / "A análise avançada ainda não está instalada. A correção gramatical continua disponível.") — lands with T16/T17.

## T20 — Offline — core proven (see T08 offline reload); full UI-driven offline E2E lands with T23.

## T22 — Unit tests — partial
- `semantic-model-store.test.js` (8): allowlist, file order, transactional install, checksum reject, cancel, artifact assembly, not-installed, removal+embedding-invalidations. More (thresholds/intent/UI-state) land with T11–T16.

## Increment commit 1: real USE provisioning runtime (loader + catalog + store + hook + config). Unit 134 green; build green; tfjs excluded from precache.
